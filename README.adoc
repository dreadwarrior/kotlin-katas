== Description

This project collects various code Katas for the JVM/Kotlin stack.

The collection contains examples of problems I have encountered during my
professional work as an employed software developer.

It is intended to reflect on debates with colleagues regarding code quality,
test coverage and solution approaches.

Furthermore, it serves as a playground for my own exercises and for improving my
skills as a software developer.

== Kata contents

Every Kata _should_ contain the following sections:

. _Problem description_: +
  Describes the problem and gives context for solving it.

. _Tasks_: +
  Using *Given*-*When*-*Then* to specify pre-conditions, behavior and
  expectations. +
  The purpose of writing tasks this way is to reflect the causal requirement of
  the Kata. If possible, avoid technical details and aim for a "big picture"
  task description.

. _Questions_: +
  Contains questions that have arisen during problem solving or a review of it.

. _Hints_: +
  Helpful tips to get you started solving the problem at hand.

. _Links_: +
  Informative links to satisfy the desire for deeper understanding.

. _Diary_ +
  Background on the genesis of the Kata.
